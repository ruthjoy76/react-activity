## Exercises:
1. Create a simple React app that displays a button and a message. When the button is clicked, the message should change to "Button clicked!".

2. Create a custom component called ToggleSwitch that displays a switch that can be turned on and off. The component should accept a handleToggle function prop that is called when the switch is toggled.

3. Modify the ToggleSwitch component from exercise 2 to accept an additional isOn boolean prop that determines the initial state of the switch. When the switch is toggled, the isOn prop should be updated to reflect the new state.
